      1. The components are independent from each other.
      2. Each component needs to implement related functional and non-functional requirements.

    Use the class diagram and program flow diagrams in the design document to MAKE SURE ALL the specified classes and functions are included in each file and are defined CORRECTLY. 
    For each class, write a DETAILED explanation of how it will be implemented, consider:
      1. Write pseudocode for each class to define the functions to be implemented.

      4. Create the class under a folder representing the component defined in the Task List.
      5. Create APIs that may be used by both the frontend and backend of the project. Use OpenAPI 3.0 format (guarded by triple backticks like: ```<CONTENT>``` so you must fill in the <CONTENT> with the API specification) to document the API endpoints, request and response structures, and authentication mechanisms.
      6. Create the main.py to run all the components implemented from one place.
